# Gym Centre Management System

AGC has segmented into three primary user roles: Staff, Trainer, and Customer. The starting point for all users is the Index Page and leading to a login page. Users will need to register and wait for staff to approve their account then only able to login. After logging in, users are directed to their respective dashboards.
Firstly, logged in as staff will be redirected to staff dashboard, then staff members can manage their profiles, trainers, customers, classes, payments, and access lists of staff if the logged in staff has super admin role. They have the capability to create, update, and delete records for these entities.
Secondly, logged in as trainer can manage their profiles and view lists of classes they handle. They can create, update, and view comments for classes, as well as view customer lists and previous feedback, and add feedback.
Lastly, customers can manage their profiles, view available classes, make payments for classes, view their enrolled classes, and provide feedback or comments.
